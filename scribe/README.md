## 📋 Prerequisites & Dependencies

**Important**: Before installing the app, ensure all required system dependencies are installed for your platform:

👉 **[Tauri Prerequisites & Dependencies](https://v2.tauri.app/start/prerequisites/)**

This includes essential packages like WebKitGTK (Linux), system libraries, and other dependencies required for Tauri applications to run properly on your operating system.

---

## Installation & Setup

### Prerequisites

- **Node.js** (v18 or higher)
- **Rust** (latest stable)
- **npm** or **yarn**

### Quick Start

```bash
# Clone the repository
git clone https://github.com/iamsrikanthnani/Scribe.git
cd Scribe

# Install dependencies
npm install

# Start development server
npm run tauri dev
```

### Build for Production

```bash
# Build the application
npm run tauri build
```

This creates platform-specific installers in `src-tauri/target/release/bundle/`:

- **macOS**: `.dmg`
- **Windows**: `.msi`, `.exe`
- **Linux**: `.deb`, `.rpm`, `.AppImage`

---

## Security & Privacy

### **Local API Key Storage**

- API keys are stored in **browser localStorage** (not sent to any server)
- **No telemetry** - your keys never leave your device
- **Session-based** - keys can be cleared anytime

### **Secure API Communication**

- **Direct HTTPS** connections to AI providers
- **No proxy servers** - your requests go straight to the AI service
- **Request signing** handled locally
- **TLS encryption** for all API communications

### **Data Handling**

- **No conversation logging** - messages aren't stored anywhere
- **Temporary session data** - cleared on app restart
- **Local file processing** - images processed in-browser
- **No analytics** - completely private usage

### **Why Frontend API Calls Are Better**

Scribe makes API calls directly from your frontend because:

1. **🔒 Maximum Privacy**: Your conversations never touch our servers
2. **🚀 Better Performance**: Direct connection = faster responses
3. **📱 Always Local**: Your data stays on your device, always
4. **🔍 Transparent**: You can inspect every network request in dev tools
5. **⚡ No Bottlenecks**: No server capacity limits or downtime

## Performance Optimizations

### **Tauri Advantages**

- **Native binary** - no JavaScript runtime overhead
- **Rust backend** - memory-safe, ultra-fast
- **Small bundle size** - ~10MB total app size
- **Instant startup** - launches in <100ms
- **Low memory usage** - typically <50MB RAM

### **Frontend Optimizations**

- **React 18** with concurrent features
- **TypeScript** for compile-time optimization
- **Vite** for lightning-fast development
- **Tree shaking** - only bundle used code
- **Lazy loading** - components load on demand
